# Funkify

Funkify is a playground for experimenting with 
<a href="https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/function-calling" target="_blank">"function calling"</a>
in large language models, specifically the GPT models from OpenAI.

It enables you to write custom functions in the browser with simple JavaScript implementations
and test how they work through a chat UI similar to ChatGPT.

Using it requires an API key you can get <a href="https://platform.openai.com/" target="_blank">here</a>.

The project is currently built by <a href="https://awmartin.xyz" target="_blank">William Martin</a>
